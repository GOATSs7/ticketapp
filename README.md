in this app we can create user via signup
we can use any name for normal users
admin login cad be done by username: "admin"
tech support member login done by username:"tech"  (this should be starts with tech and after that we can use any name to member) 


//after login we redirect to specific page (eg.user,admin, tech support)

user can genrate ticket ,can resolve/close the ticket 
also only user can delete the ticket

//admin
admin can view all users ,tech members and all tickets
admin also can assign the ticket ans also has resole/close options

for routing i use react router, backend done with express.js and database is mongodb

 code has lot improvements but due to time bound i am not able to fully complete this task
there are lots of optimisation need in this code
